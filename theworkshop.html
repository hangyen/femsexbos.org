				<h1>The Workshop</h1><br>
					<h3>What is the Femsex Workshop?</h3>
					<p>The Femsex Workshop is a peer facilitated 16 week workshop that uses peer-to-peer learning, readings, discussions, and self-exploration to engage people in an honest and open dialogue about female identity. We strive to cover a range of topics relevant to the female experience, with an emphasis on ones that are often tabooed or silenced. </p>

					<h3>When and where is this workshop?</h3>
					<p>Our Spring workshop will start on January 27th, 2014 and run until May 12th, 2014. We will meet once a week for 3 hours each week in either Somerville, Cambridge, or Boston. The day of the week is still to be determined but will most likely run from 6:30/7PM to 9:30/10PM on a weeknight. </p>

					<h3>Who can take this workshop?</h3>
					<p>TThe value in the Femsex Workshop is the diversity of experiences that our participants bring to the class. We welcome anybody who have or has ever had experience with the female sex or gender including: individuals of all races, nationalities, gender identities (including transgender FTM, MTF, genderqueer, pangender, intersex, transsexual, and cisgender women), sexual orientations (including straight, lesbian, gay, queer, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual), sexual experiences, sexual interests, political leanings, religious affiliations, age, income levels, and occupations. We ask that you come into the workshop with an open mind, respect for your peers and a willingness to share your story. You must be over 18 to participate. </p>

					<h3>How much will this workshop cost?</h3>
					<p>We operate on a donation basis, with a sliding scale of up to $60. Your donation will go towards hosting guest speakers, class materials, website operation, and growing our workshops. No one will be turned away for financial reasons, but donations are strongly encouraged as your means allow.</p>

					<h3>How big is this workshop?</h3>
					<p>Because we would like to have a small and intimate class setting, we will be capping the class at 14 participants.</p>

					<h3>How much of a time commitment do I have to make?</h3>
					<p>One of our goals is to build a safe community. To do so requires a commitment from you to attend and be present, both physically and mentally, for each session. We hope that you can attend all 16 sessions in a season but realize that things come up. Our policy is that you need to attend at least 13 of the 16 sessions.  As for time spent outside of class on Fem(s)ex readings and activities, this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour each week. </p>

					<h3>What topics are covered in the workshop?</h3>
					<p>Check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h95go_S0vnS8ujvlAUNKg9tvO-ogONt0Rrkde2z2CXo/edit" target= "_blank">Syllabus</a></p>

					<h3>Who will be my teacher?</h3>
					<p>There are no teachers in this workshop! The Femsex Workshop does not operate on a teacher-student model but instead relies on peer-to-peer learning as one of its main drivers and sources of empowerment and inspiration. You will have two facilitators who will serve as guides throughout the workshop. They will lead the exercises and discussions during class but they are by no means experts. You are here to learn from each other. </p>

					<h3>Why does it have to be 3 hours? That's so long!</h3>
					<p>3 hours definitely sounds long but we promise,  it goes by quickly! We have a lot of material to cover in each class and feel that having a larger chunk of time (as opposed to splitting it up into 1.5 hr sessions) is more effective at building trust and community.</p>

					<h3>Is there homework?</h3>
					<p>There will be readings that accompany each class as well as short activities that we would like you to accomplish outside of class time. Donâ€™t worry, no papers! The exercises are meant to be fun and exploratory.</p>

					<h3>I'm still confused.</h3>
					<p>No worries! Come to one of our info sessions and/or sign up on our mailing list to make sure you get reminders about our info sessions and application dates.</p>
