				<h2>Why Femsex Boston?</h2>
				<video></video>
				<p>Femsex Boston is a community-based organization focused on delivering The Femsex Workshop to the Boston community. Through this workshop, we seek to build a space for people to share their stories, to engage in honest and open dialogue, and to explore and challenge the experiences, the ideals, and the externalized and internalized structures that have been defining gender and sexual identity for generations. <p>

				<h1> Our History</h1>
				<h2>Femsex is a movement</h2>
					<p>Although we are just taking our baby steps, the Femsex movement has been around for quite some time. The first workshop began at the University of Berkeley, where students created and led a womenâ€™s empowerment course for their peers. Since then, the Femsex movement has spread across the country via inspired and empowered Femsex-ies from California to DC, Providence, Miami, and now, we are glad to announce, Boston!<p>
